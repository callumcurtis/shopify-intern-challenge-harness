# Shopify Intern Challenge Harness

Harness for the Shopify 2025 internship challenge.

## Why This Repo

The provided [template repo](https://github.com/DevDegree/eng-intern-challenge) specifies that
only the `translator` file should be modified, and the test file should not be altered at all.

Since I want to add additional tests, I decided to create this repo to wrap my solution and
house any code or documentation that does not belong in the `translator` file. This way,
I don't accidentally break the automated validation used to check my solution.
